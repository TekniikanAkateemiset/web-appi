Same basic functions or subset of them that are offered by mobile clients.

Ideas:
- Easy connect me request to TEK's personnel
- Easy login to www.tek.fi web-pages.
- Possibility to see and update users own member information like phone etc.
- Newsfeed from www.tek.fi
- Event feed form www.tek.fi
- Some grouping related info like feed from teekkarintyokirja.tek.fi for students at least part of the year (scheduling options)
- Palkkanosturi
- ...

From user interface
- Front page with navigation to sections, that may be member type or time dependent.
- Each section list of content in title, summary picture list style.
